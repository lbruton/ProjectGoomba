## 🔖 Prompt

```
You are working on the ProjectGoombaStomp CLI utility (command name: "goomba").
Its job is to scan a directory, dump its structure and relevant file contents to Markdown,
and optionally export PDF/ZIP versions. The code lives in projectgoombastomp/.

Current version: 1.0.4 (2025-08-07)
Key flags:
  --include-code  Include code files (.py,.js,.html,.css)
  --pdf           Render PDF
  --zip           Create ZIP

Focus on improving UX, UTF‑8 safety, and performance. Let's pick up from here.
```

Paste that into your LLM session and start iterating.
