## Development Notes

This release represents a complete rewrite and cleanup of the original codebase, focusing on:

1. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
2. **Usability**: Simplified installation and clearer documentation
3. **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented code structure
4. **Compatibility**: Works across different Python versions and operating systems

The PDF generation issue from previous versions has been completely resolved by switching to system fonts and improving the text rendering pipeline.
