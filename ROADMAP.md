## 📋 Phase 1: Polish & Usability (v1.1.x)

### 🎛️ Enhanced Configuration
**Goal**: Give users control without overwhelming them

#### v1.1.0 - Configuration System
- **Simple Config File**: `goomba.yml` in project root
  ```yaml
  # Example goomba.yml
  exclude:
    - "*.log"
    - "node_modules/**"
    - ".env*"
  include_code: true
  max_file_size: "2MB"
  output_format: ["md", "pdf"]
  ```
- **CLI Override**: All config options available as CLI flags
- **Smart Defaults**: Sensible exclusions (node_modules, .git, etc.)

#### v1.1.1 - Output Improvements
- **Collapsible Sections**: Large files get "Show more..." treatment in output
- **File Previews**: First 50 lines for very large files, with "truncated" notice
- **Better PDF Layout**: Page breaks, headers, improved font handling
- **Table of Contents**: Clickable TOC for large projects

#### v1.1.2 - Quality of Life
- **Progress Indicators**: Show current file being processed
- **Dry Run Mode**: `--dry-run` to preview what would be processed
- **Verbose Mode**: `--verbose` for debugging issues
- **Size Warnings**: Alert when output might be very large

**Development Effort**: ~6 weeks  
**Risk**: Low - builds on existing solid foundation

---

## 📊 Phase 2: Smart Features (v1.2.x)

### 🧠 Intelligent Analysis
**Goal**: Add value through automated insights

#### v1.2.0 - Code Intelligence
- **TODO/FIXME Scanner**: Extract and summarize action items
  ```
  📝 Action Items Found (12 total):
  
  🔴 Critical TODOs (3):
  - src/auth.py:45 - TODO: Add proper error handling for expired tokens
  - config/database.py:12 - FIXME: Connection pool is leaking memory
  
  🟡 Standard TODOs (9):
  - Multiple files contain "TODO: Add tests"
  ```

- **Dependency Detection**: Identify key dependencies and versions
- **Language Statistics**: Breakdown by file types, lines of code
- **Documentation Coverage**: Identify files missing README/comments

#### v1.2.1 - Project Health
- **Quick Health Check**: Simple metrics about project state
  - Files without recent changes
  - Large files that might need attention
  - Potential sensitive data warnings (API keys, passwords)
- **Change Analysis**: If git repo, show recent activity patterns

#### v1.2.2 - Smart Filtering
- **Auto-Exclusions**: Intelligent detection of build artifacts, logs, binaries
- **Language-Specific Rules**: Better defaults based on detected project type
- **Size-Based Filtering**: Smart handling of large files vs tiny config files

**Development Effort**: ~8 weeks  
**Risk**: Medium - requires new analysis engine, but scoped features

---

## ⚡ Phase 3: Integration (v1.3.x)

### 🔄 Workflow Integration
**Goal**: Fit seamlessly into development workflows

#### v1.3.0 - Git Integration
- **Repository Context**: Show git status, branch, recent commits in output
- **Change Highlighting**: Mark recently modified files in output
- **Diff Mode**: `goomba diff` to show changes since last run
- **Ignore Respect**: Automatically respect .gitignore rules

#### v1.3.1 - Watch Mode
- **Live Updates**: `goomba --watch` for continuous documentation
- **Smart Rebuilding**: Only reprocess changed files
- **Notification System**: Desktop notifications when docs are updated

#### v1.3.2 - Enhanced Outputs
- **HTML Export**: Interactive file browser with search
- **Comparison Mode**: Compare two project states side-by-side
- **Template System**: Custom output templates for different use cases

**Development Effort**: ~10 weeks  
**Risk**: Medium-High - significant new features, but optional
